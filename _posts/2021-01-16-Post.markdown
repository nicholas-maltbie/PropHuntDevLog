Weekly updates are still going (but just on Saturday instead of Friday).

## Added Features

Added a new map

</div>

There haven't been too many big code changes, mostly just making the map and planning out the prop disguise.


## Future Plans

Alright, so the game development has been going pretty slowly and DOTS has lead to a lot of dead ends so far in development (Loading new scenes, baked lighting, some network communication).

In interest of finishing the project and adding new developers, I'm going to switch the platform to the easier to use (and more finished) library [Mirror](https://mirror-networking.com/). New git repo will be started today and moving away from ECS.
