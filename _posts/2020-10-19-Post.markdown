This post is quite a bit late being written on 11/09/20 but backwriting to fill out the log.

By this point in the project the major features being added included finishing the basic Kinematic Character Controller and all of it's associated features. 

Many of the issues that were hampering the project were resolved as well as stair snapping being added in [PR #103](https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/PropHunt/pull/103)

Here is a sample animation of the character walking up and down stairs before and after stair snapping

# Why is this post late?

This post is late because I have been extra busy with coursework. I'm behind on most of the deadlines but this project can be drug out a bit longer, there aren't any hard deadlines and most of those were made to help me focus on the project, not to stress me out about getting it done before a release window.

I would have to say I have also been extremely frustrated with the lack of stability in the DOTS packages but what cna you expect from these preview system (sighhhh).

# Summary of updates

Here are all of the PRs and quick summaries for them that were made between 10-05-20 and 10-19-20.
* October 9th, 2020 - [PR #102](https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/PropHunt/pull/103) Adding vertical character controller snapping

I still want to document and make the project more clear to new users or people interested in learning about DOTS and this project.
