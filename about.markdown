This is a website about the development log of the project [PropHunt](https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/PropHunt).

PropHunt is a game popularly implemented in Gary's Mod. 

The game generally consists of players being split into two teams (props and hunters). Then the props will hide and hunters will attempt to find them in a game of hide and seek. Props can change into objects found in the environment to disguise themselves.

The Project is made using [Unity 3D's Data Oriented Technology Stack](https://unity.com/dots). For more information about the project development, see the [PropHunt Github Wiki](https://github.com/nicholas-maltbie/PropHunt/wiki). This will also have information about how the project is developed and how all the various components work together.
